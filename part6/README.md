# arduino-nextion-serial-communictaion
Part 6 is a spezial version that displays the pressure as well as the battery voltage from a LiFePo4 (4s2p) motorcycle battery
* freeruning analog read
* smoothing the values
* direct serial communication between Arduino and Nextion Display
  * using Nextion progressbar

## bill of material
* Arduino Uno
* Analog Pressure Sensors (MPX4115AP)
* Capacitors 1ÂµF and 100nF
* Nextion NX3224T024_011R
* LiFePo4 motorcycle battery with balancer connector
