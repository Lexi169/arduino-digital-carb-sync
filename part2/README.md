# arduino-free-running-analog-read
Part 2 covers fast reading and smoothing of analog values. Additionally the min values are determined.

## bill of material
* Arduino Uno
* Analog Pressure Sensors (MPX4115AP)
* Capacitors 1ÂµF and 100nF

## serial plot
The following graph shows the measurement curves of the two pressure sensors. The blue line shows the first pressure sensor (right cylinder), the grenn line the second (left cylinder). The orange an red line depics the minimum values from each cylinder.
